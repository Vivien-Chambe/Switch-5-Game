# Switch-5-Game
In this game you have to switch green and yellow pegs position following two rules:
- Pegs can only move forward (to left for yellow pegs and to right for green pegs)
- Pegs can go if there is a blank space after or, if there is an other peg, you need to have a free 
space after.

I choose to go for Python because of the Pygame library to learn how to use it and try to solve this little challenge after i tried to solve it in real life.
